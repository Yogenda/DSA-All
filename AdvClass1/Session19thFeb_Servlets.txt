how to start server

http://servername:portno/appname/filename.html

In every system, if the server is local, then servername : "localhost"

Server identified with either name/ip address
IP Address :- "127.0.0.1"

portnumber :- It is a number which meant for identifing application uniqly
by default local server having 8080. if we need, we can change that port number. 

usually port numbers are b/w 0 - 65535, but 0- 1024 numbers are already used for system config.

http://localhost:8080/AppName/abc.html
or 
http://127.0.0.1:8080/AppName/abc.html

Server has to start first before executing any page
once all the pages are executed, 
we can stop server.

http://127.0.0.1:8080/AppName/abc.html
http://localhost:8081/SampleWebApplication/

http://localhost:8081/SampleWebApplication/Demo.html
file:///C:/Phase2Weekend/Register.html

As per Java, there are two web technologies

1. Servlets
2. JSP (Java Server Pages)

Servlets :- It is a web technology which meant for create serverside web applications.

Servlet is a technology is useing creating web pages which will run on server. 

Basically sites are two types 

Static Websites		it has information fixed.

Dynamic Websites	it has information changing according to requirement.

to work with servlets

Servlet is a java class which has web programming. 

class demoweb
{

}

there are an interface, and two classes are used to make a servlet class as web component. 

servlet :- interface

GenericServlet, HttpServlet are the classes

class demoweb  implements Servlet
{
	public void init()
	{

	}

	public void service()
	{
		Actual task of the servlet has to be defined in service()
	}

	public void destory()

		it will delete  servlet copy once task is done.
	}
}

class demoweb extends HttpServlet
{

}

servlet interface having following methods

init()

service()

destroy()

getServletInfo()


 
java provides all the external library with a special files called as "Jar" files. 
Jar files are special executable files where it consist of classes and interfaces. 

for servlet technology:  we have use "servlet-api.jar"
