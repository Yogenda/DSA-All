Big O
All the company uses the Big O (amazon, Google, FB, .etc)

It is known as Big O asymptotic analysis - 

Any problem can be solved in various ways but we have to analyse the best way the proble is solved. And here the Big O helps us. It tells us how well the problem is solved.

What is good code?
Readable: It should be clean and other programer can read your code.
Scalable: Big O allow us to scale our code.
	It means allows us to measure the scalability 
	
If we want to bake a cake there are 2 ways 
First if good: we refer the recipe book and then step by step with the measurements we prepare the cake.
Second is bad:

Same our machine works: -> we give the instructions to the machine -> it executer it internally -> provides us the output.

As there are many to cook same ways there are many ways to solve the problem (efficent or non efficient) 


const nemo = ['nemo'];

function findNemo(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] == 'nemo') {
      console.log('Found Nemo');
    }
  }
}

findNemo(nemo);
