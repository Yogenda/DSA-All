Arrays:
	These are some time called as list which organizes the item sequensily.

eg: 0 apple
	1 mango
	3 car
	4 bike 
	5 train
	6... etc

Arrays are the most use Data structure and have less amount of rules.

as they are stored in contigous memory ie, in order they have the smallest foot prints of any Data structure.
 
If you want to ittrate the data and display it in sequence then array are the best choice.

lookup O(1)
push O(1)
insert O(n)
delete O(n)

for java (Class_1_Array.java)
const strings = ['a','b','c','d'];
//4*4 = 16 bytes of storage
strings[2];
//push
strings.push('e'); //O(1)
//pop
strings.pop(); //O(1)
//unshift
strings.unshift('x'); //O(n)
//splice
strings.splice(2,0,'alien'); //O(n)
console.log(strings);

TYPES OF ARRAY
Their are 2 types of arrays 
	1. Static: they are fixed in size, you need to specify the number of elements your array will hold ahead of time.
	to solve this we have our next type of array.
	
	2. Dynamic: it allow us to copy and rebuild the array to a new location with more memory.
	
in java array list works dynamically by default.

----------------------------------------
Problem is to create a function that reverse a string;

//'hi my name is yogendra'
//'ardnegy is eman ym ih'



function reverse(str){
  //check input
  if(!str || str.length < 2 || typeof str !== 'string'){
    return 'hmm that is not good';
  }
  const backwards = [];
  const totalItems = str.length - 1;
  for(let i = totalItems; i >= 0; i--){
    backwards.push(str[i]);
  }
  console.log(backwards);
  return backwards.join('');
}
