What is a JSP?

It is also a web technology is used to develop server side web applications. 

It has been developed on the top of Servlets because to overcome limitations of the servlets. 

1.  jsp is a extension of servlets. 
2.  Servlets allows write html and java by combining, whereas jsp will not do that, jsp separates
	java code and html code within the same page. 
3.  Jsp provides other facilities / features to make develop process very easy for the developer. 

	A.  JSP gives a language called JSTL(Java(JSP) Standard Tag Library)
		it can be used along with html, css, javascript. 
	B.  It will provide lot of implicit objects  for the classes as follows
			HttpServletResponse 	=  response
			HttpServletRequest	=  request
			PrintWriter		=  out
			HttpSession 		=  session
	C.  JSP technology used jsp pages i.e. web page having an extension .jsp
			these pages allows to write html, css,javascript along with java code. 
			whenever we need to write any java code use Scriptlet tag as follows
				<%
					java code
				%>
	D.  To import any package in jsp file use following statement 
		<%@ page import="pacakge name" %>

	E.  Jsp allow to call one page within another page. 
		<jsp:include  page="pagename" />

	F.  Jsp allows to move from one page to another page. 
		<jsp:forward  page="pagename" />

	G.  Tag Library(taglib) :- It is a directive declaration of jsp pages where it consist set of 			custom tags.  It has a library in the form of url. 

			First download and add "jstl-1.2.jar" file and copy paste this file into 
				lib folder of WEB-INF folder. 

			Example for custom tags
			if Condition  :  <:if ...>  
					prefix is a word or letter what we define. 
				<prefix:forEach ....  />
				<prefix:out .... />

			There are different types of custom tags
				Core Tags
				Function Tags
				SQL Tags
				XML Tags
				Formatting Tags
			Core Tags:- 
				These tags are used to perform following things 
					Variable Supports
					Control statements
					URL Managements
			To use core tags :- 
			<%@ taglib  uri="http://java.sun.com/jstl/core"  prefix="word" %>

	Note:-  For any type of custom tags are existed in a specific url 
				"http://java.sun.com/jstl"


			<c:out> is used to print someting on the browser. 
			<c:out value="${'text'/variable}" />
			<c:set>  is used to create and assign value to a variable
			<c:set var="variable name" scope="session" value="${value} />
			<c:remove> is used to delete value from variable
			<c:remove  var="variablename" />
			<c:if> is used to check condition
			<c:if test="${condition}>
				set of statements
			</c:if>
			<c:forEach> is used for loop
			<c:forEach  var="name"  begin="statval"  end="endval">
				body of the loop
			</c:forEach>
			<c:redirect>  is used to move from one page to another page or any website. 
			<c:redirect url="pagename/sitename"/>
--------------------
Note:-  Once dynamic web application created, add following two jar files form tomcat server. 
			servlet-api.jar
			jsp-api.jar
