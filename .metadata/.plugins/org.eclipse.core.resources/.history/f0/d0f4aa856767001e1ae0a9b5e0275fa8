As every time it takes different time and consume lot or time of user so lets make our code more efficent.
Time depend on the cpu and the device you are woking on.

const nemo = new Array(100000).fill('nemo');

function findNemo(array) {
  let t0 = performance.now();
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] == 'nemo') {
      console.log('Found Nemo');
    }
  }
  let t1 = performance.now();
  console.log('Call to find Nemo took ' + (t1 - t0) + 'milliseconds');
}

findNemo(nemo);

big o is nothing but just it helps us to compare between 2 algorithm which one runs faster.
