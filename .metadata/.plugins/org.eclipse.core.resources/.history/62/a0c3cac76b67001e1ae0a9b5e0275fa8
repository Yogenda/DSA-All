what if i will ask you what is the Big O of our function nemo.

as our number of elements increases same our number of operations increases.
so this is Linear.

Here we learned our first Big O notation which is O(n) --> Linear time.

n -> it can be anything it means O depends on the number of inputs 'n' O(n).

It is the most common notation that we find.

Note: Big O does'nt calculate things in seconds instead we check how quickly it runs.
	It completly depends on the number of inputs we have and number of operations it increases.
